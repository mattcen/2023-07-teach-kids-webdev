Note:

- GovHack as inspiration
- getting people interested in IT and giving them a taste
- create legion of devs; youth leading, adults supporting


## what is scouting, and how does STEM fit  into it?
- ref award scheme and "STEM & Innovation" [SIA](https://scoutsvictoria.com.au/activities-events/special-interest-areas/)
## motivations
## plan outline
- networking basics
- CSS
- server-side scripting, originally PHP, now Python Flask (maybe switch to FastAPI?)

## constraints
- no internet due to location
- want to *simulate* internet (having one's own website and domain ) nonetheless
- low-powered laptops
- not all participants had own computers and that leads to heterogeneity
- many students have no prior knowledge, and in the age of mobile/tablets, may not use traditional computers currently, or understand the filesystem metaphor

...

## Outline

- I'm a scout leader in Australia
- when they hear "scouts", some folks think of "boy scouts", but in AU it's an inclusive all-gender thing
- scouts don't just do outdoor skills like camping or hiking any more.
- they get to choose their own activities, and in Australia we've recently overhauled our award/badge scheme to be more flexible
we now have a ![STEM & Innovation](https://scoutsvictoria.com.au/media/5774/stem-and-innovation-icon-solid.png?width=160&height=160&mode=max) Special Interest Area badge

- For several years I've been involved not just as a line leader facilitating youth program, but working on larger state/branch-level projects, which often require or benefit from the creation or customization of software tools to facilitate them. (can elaborate about this offline)
- A lot of the time, this software has been primarily or exclusively built and managed by me
- After chatting with Luke, we decided to see how we go getting youth more involved, given we're a Youth Leading, Adults Supporting organisation
- With inspiration from GovHack, a hackathon we've both run in recent years, we decided on a weekend-length event to gove scouts a crash-course in website development
- at the time (mid-2021), Melbourne was in-and-out of COVID lockdowns so we weren't sure if/when we'd be able to do this, and planned it online often via Jitsi video calls, with only a few weeks' notice

- booked a scout camp with a newly built self-contained lodge; over 20 beds, bathrooms, kitchen, and large hall, and importantly, plenty of power
- â€¦ but no internet
- we chose to use this as a teaching opportunity to walk the scouts through the distinction between the internet, a network (or LAN), and "wifi"

- Andy, one of our leaders, had access to around 100 Toshiba Tecra M10 laptops (older now than many of the scouts we're teaching) donated from a school
- Luke had access to an old rack-mount Dell server
- We assembled an IR classroom with the above and:
	- a bunch of old switches
	- network cables
	- extension cords and power strips
	- old VGA monitors

- our broad syllabus was:
	- HTML
	- CSS
	- Server-side scripting
- we really winged it the first time around
- but the scouts loved it
- Luke decided it would be a great idea for me to act as a computer while the scouts instructed me to make a sandwich (insert photo)

- after the first time around we decided to switch from PHP to Python Flask, because most of the apps we had been doing as leaders were in Python

- so let's talk about how we did all this technically

Laptops:

- Xubuntu
- VS Code
- Firefox

Server:

- Ubuntu
- dnsmasq
- Docker
- [Traefik](https://traefik.io/traefik/) listening on port 80 (LAN-only; no HTTPS)
- [sshpiper](https://github.com/tg123/sshpiper/) listening on port 22

- Each Scout got root access on a Docker container

- \*.scouthack pointed at the server
- Traefik redirected \<username\>.scouthack to a given scout's Docker container's port 80
- sshpiper redirected SSH connections with a given username to that scout's container's SSH server
- VS Code on laptops used the SSH remote to connect to the Docker container and run web services there

Down-time

- Local Minetest servers
- Interesting to note: first time when scouts could bring their own computers, one had Minecraft and felt superiour playing that while others played Minetest, until they realised they were playing alone, and then asked us to set up Minetest for them. Hooray, Network Effects!

Future ideas

- FastAPI
- Web-based VS Code
- Jupyter Notebooks
